0. Simulate the project without modification. Check that the output corresponds
to a SOS signal in Morse code (... ___...).
Keep a proof of this simulation.

1. Copy the SOS_TITANIC directory (with the cp command) into a
new VICTOIRE directory and change the code so that the output corresponds
to the Morse signal of the V (... _ ). Adapt the name of the module (victoire)
of the TITANIC.V file to VICTOIRE.V and the makefile in coherence.
Simulate the new project. Keep a proof of this simulation.
