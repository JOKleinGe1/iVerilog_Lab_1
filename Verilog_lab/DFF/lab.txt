0. Simulate the project without modification. Verify that it is indeed a
D flip-flop active on rising edge (DFF).

1. Modify the DFF flip-flop code to integrate a synchronous reset.
Adapt the testbench code so that it can verify that the
reset function is correct. Keep proof of this operation
(waveform).
