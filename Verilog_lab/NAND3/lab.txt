0. Simulate the project without modification. Check that the function
corresponds to a 3-input NAND gate.

1. Modify the code of the test.v file so that the simulation runs
the different configurations of the C, B, A input in the order in which
these configurations appear in a truth table (000, 001, 010, ...
111). Simulate to verify.

2. Copy the entire NAND3 directory (with the cp command) into a new
NOR3 directory. Change the NAND3 function to NOR3 in the NAND3 code and
adapt the file names and the makefile to be consistent with this new
function. (NAND3.V -> NOR3.V) and the module name (NAND3 -> NOR3).
