1. Compile the project and check the simulation. Does the counter count milliseconds or microseconds? Check the size of the generated files (with the ls -al command for example).

2. Modify the source code so that the counting operates on milliseconds.
Also modify the testbench so that the counting can be seen.
Check the size of the generated files.
